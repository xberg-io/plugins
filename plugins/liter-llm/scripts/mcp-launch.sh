#!/usr/bin/env bash
# liter-llm MCP launcher — ensures a working liter-llm binary is available, then
# exec's it as an MCP server with the forwarded arguments (the plugin passes
# `mcp --transport stdio`).
#
# Why this exists: the Claude Code plugin ships manifests + scripts, not a
# compiled binary. Rather than require users to install liter-llm first, this
# launcher locates or installs a binary on first run, preferring tools the user
# likely already has. Every step FALLS THROUGH to the next on any failure, so
# the launcher self-heals as more distribution channels come online.
#
# Resolution order (override with LITER_LLM_LAUNCHER=auto|npx|uvx|brew|download):
#
#   a) Any working liter-llm binary (cached in the plugin's bin/, or on PATH
#      from a prior brew install) — fastest, no network. ANY working binary is
#      accepted; the launcher does NOT pin a version (the plugin's own version
#      is unrelated to the tool's version).
#   b) npx: probe the published npm package, and if it exposes the CLI, run it.
#   c) uvx: probe the published PyPI package, and if it exposes the CLI, run it.
#   d) brew install xberg-io/tap/liter-llm, then exec the on-PATH binary.
#   e) Checksum-verified download of the prebuilt CLI archive from the tool's
#      LATEST GitHub release. The latest tag is resolved via the GitHub API; the
#      versioned asset + SHA256SUMS file are then fetched and verified.
#   f) Give up with guidance (brew tap, or `cargo install liter-llm-cli`).
#
# `auto` tries every step in order; an explicit value pins that single channel
# (each still first honors an already-present binary in step (a)).
#
# The liter-llm CLI crate IS published to crates.io, so `cargo install
# liter-llm-cli` works. It is intentionally absent from the auto-resolution
# steps above because it compiles from source (slow, needs a Rust toolchain);
# the launcher prefers prebuilt channels. `cargo install --git` builds the
# unreleased repo HEAD. Both appear in the final guidance below.
#
# Note on npx/uvx: the liter-llm npm and PyPI CLI packages are being rolled out
# (the package self-installs/runs the binary, basemind-style). They may not be
# published yet, so each is PROBED first and falls through cleanly if absent.
# The `@xberg-io/*` / `liter-llm` binding packages (NAPI-RS / PyO3) are language
# SDKs, NOT the CLI — they are not used here.
#
# CRITICAL: stdout is the MCP stdio protocol channel. Every diagnostic in this
# script MUST go to stderr (>&2). Only the exec'd binary may write to stdout.
