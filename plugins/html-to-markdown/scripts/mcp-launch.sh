#!/usr/bin/env bash
# html-to-markdown MCP launcher — ensures a working html-to-markdown binary is
# available, then exec's it with the forwarded arguments (the plugin passes
# `mcp`).
#
# Why this exists: the Claude Code plugin ships manifests + scripts, not a
# compiled binary. Rather than require users to install html-to-markdown first,
# this launcher locates or installs a binary on first run, preferring tools the
# user likely already has. Every step FALLS THROUGH to the next on any failure,
# so the launcher self-heals as more distribution channels come online.
#
# Resolution order (override with HTML_TO_MARKDOWN_LAUNCHER=auto|npx|uvx|brew|download):
#
#   a) An existing html-to-markdown on PATH, or cached at $PLUGIN_ROOT/bin — any
#      working binary is accepted (no version match: the CLI release line and the
#      plugin version line are independent).
#   b) npx: probe the published npm CLI package, and if it exposes the CLI, run it.
#   c) uvx: probe the published PyPI CLI package, and if it exposes the CLI, run it.
#   d) brew install xberg-io/tap/html-to-markdown, then exec the on-PATH binary.
#   e) Direct download of the prebuilt CLI archive from the GitHub LATEST release.
#   f) Fail with guidance (brew tap, or `cargo install --git` from source).
#
# `auto` tries every step in order; an explicit value pins that single channel
# (each still first honors an already-present binary in step (a)).
#
# The html-to-markdown CLI crate is NOT published to crates.io, so `cargo install
# html-to-markdown-cli` (registry form) does not work and is intentionally
# absent. The only cargo path that works is `cargo install --git`, which compiles
# from the repo — see the final guidance below.
#
# Note on npx/uvx: the html-to-markdown-cli npm and PyPI proxy packages are being
# rolled out (the package self-installs/runs the binary, basemind-style). They may
# not be published yet, so each is PROBED first and falls through cleanly if
# absent. The `@xberg-io/html-to-markdown` npm package and the importable
# `html-to-markdown` pip package are language SDKs/bindings, NOT the CLI — they
# are not used here.
#
# Note on the download channel: html-to-markdown publishes CLI assets named
# `html-to-markdown-<triple>.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows) with NO version in the
# asset name, so we fetch from `releases/latest/download/`. No checksums are
# published alongside the archives, so integrity is TLS-only — we WARN on every
# download and never silently trust. brew/cargo are verified by their own
# tooling and are the recommended install paths.
#
# Note on the MCP subcommand: the `html-to-markdown mcp` server ships in a recent
# release of the tool. An older binary on PATH may not expose it yet; if so,
# update the binary (brew upgrade / re-download) to pick up the `mcp` subcommand.
#
# CRITICAL: stdout is the MCP stdio protocol channel. Every diagnostic in this
# script MUST go to stderr (>&2). Only the exec'd binary may write to stdout.
